# YOLO_Object_Detection
This is an object detection project with YOLO algorithm
This project is part of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)-Convolutional Neural Networks course on Coursera. These series of courses are offered by deeplearning.ai and instructed by Andrew Ng.

# Credit
This repo is my work for the [Deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) Convolutional Neural Networks - YOLO project and the code base was taken from Corsera's [Deepl Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).


# YOLO Implementation and Prediction
In this project, YOLO was applied for the car detection task. The figures and video are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning-Convolutional Neural Networks course. The video shows how it is able to detect the cars and put a bounding box around them.
